# goKrypt
An encrytion package written in Go to encrypt passwords/strings using AES and pbkfs2 key format. This project was mainly created for a backend project i was doing where i had to store user passwords in the database.

#### Why do this, when go comes with bcrypt?
The main reason for me was to learn and explore more and new aspects of GoLang. So i tried to create this and it is by no means this was created for a production grade application. It was only a personal project where i was learning backend in GoLang. So why not :D

#### Make sure you have go installed and running, if you don't then refer to the official website(https://golang.org/)

## How to run
1. Clone ``` git clone https://github.com/ramanverma2k/gokrypt ```.
2. Change directory to the cloned repo.
3. Run ``` go get ```
4. Run ``` go run main.go ```

## What does the Future hold for this project?
Honestly, i don't know. I might create a cli but maybe not but for meanwhile i will keep it as it is.
